# NotBlank

Returns nil if the receiver is empty or blank.

Replace code like this:

```ruby
return a unless a.blank?
return b unless b.blank?
return c
```

with this:

```ruby
a.nb || b.nb || c
```

Replace code like this:

```ruby
arr = get_list_of_things.delete_if { |a| a.blank? }
arr.empty? ? nil : arr
```

with this:

```ruby
get_list_of_things.nb
```

Caution : this is not just a simple wrapper around `blank?` ; when the receiver is Enumerable, `nb`
returns a new Enumerable containing non-blank elements, or nil if there are no non-blank elements.
If the receiver is a Hash, `nb` returns a new hash containing only non-blank values, or nil if there
are no non-blank values. Hash#`nb` does not look at keys.

## Installation
